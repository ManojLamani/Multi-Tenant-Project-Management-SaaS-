## 📖 1. Problem Statement

### 1.1 Overview
Organizations require a centralized platform to manage projects, assign tasks, and track team progress efficiently. However, many existing tools are expensive, overly complex, or not customizable for small and medium teams. 

This project builds a scalable **Multi-Tenant Project Management SaaS** platform where multiple organizations can manage their projects independently using a single backend system with strict data isolation and role-based access control.

### 1.2 Why It Matters
Managing projects without structured systems leads to poor task tracking, lack of accountability, missed deadlines, and data confusion across teams. 
A multi-tenant SaaS platform ensures secure data isolation per organization, scalable architecture, cost-effective shared infrastructure, and controlled access via roles.

### 1.3 Key Inputs and Expected Outputs

| Inputs | Process | Expected Outputs |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Organization registration details | Create tenant entry in MongoDB | Isolated organization workspace |
| User signup/login credentials | JWT authentication & bcrypt validation | Secure login token |
| Project details (Name, Description) | Store with tenantId mapping | Project dashboard listing |
| Task details (Title, Status, Priority) | Linked to project & tenant | Updated task board |
| Role assignment (Owner/Manager/Member) | Role middleware validation | Controlled access to resources |

## 🎯 2. Functional Scope

### 2.1 Core Features (Must-Haves)
- **Organization Management** (Multi-Tenant Support)
- **User Authentication** (Login/Signup)
- **Role-Based Access Control** (Owner, Manager, Member)
- **Project Management** (CRUD operations)
- **Task Management** (CRUD with status tracking)
- **Tenant-Based Data Isolation**
- **Dashboard View** for project tracking

### 2.2 Stretch Goals (If Time Permits)
- Activity Logs (Track task changes)
- Project progress analytics
- Soft delete implementation
- Subscription logic (Free / Pro plans)
- API documentation using Swagger
- Search & filtering system

### 2.3 Libraries / Tools
- **Backend:** Node.js & Express.js
- **Database:** MongoDB & Mongoose
- **Frontend:** React.js
- **Security:** JWT (jsonwebtoken) & bcrypt
- **Tools:** Postman (API testing), Git & GitHub (Version control)

## ⚙️ 3. System & Design Thinking

### 3.1 App Flow / Pipeline
1. **Organization Registration:** Owner creates an organization and a `tenantId` is generated.
2. **User Authentication:** Users sign up/login and receive a JWT containing `userId`, `tenantId`, and `role`.
3. **Middleware Processing:** Every API request passes through authentication and tenant isolation middleware.
4. **Project Creation:** Projects are created with a `tenantId` reference.
5. **Task Assignment:** Tasks are linked to projects and filtered by `tenantId`.
6. **Role Validation:** Middleware ensures only authorized users can modify resources (Owner / Manager / Member).
7. **Dashboard Rendering:** React frontend fetches tenant-specific data via secure APIs.

### 3.2 Testing Strategy
- Test JWT authentication and token validation.
- Verify tenant isolation between organizations.
- Test CRUD operations for projects and tasks.
- Validate role-based restrictions.
- Test error handling and response time.
